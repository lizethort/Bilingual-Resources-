    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>As a 1st grade bilingual teacher myself, I understand how challenging it can be to find quality materials that truly support your students. That’s why I created this website—to share a collection of free, easy-to-access resources that can help you in your classroom. Here, you’ll find a variety of tools, websites, and ideas designed to support your multilingual learners, save you planning time, and make teaching a little easier. I also provide suggestions and tips to help you implement these resources effectively and create an engaging, inclusive classroom. My hope is that these resources will inspire you, empower your students, and make your bilingual teaching journey a little smoother.</p>
