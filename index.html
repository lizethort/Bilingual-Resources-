    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Hi there! As a 1st grade bilingual teacher myself, I know firsthand how challenging it can be to find quality materials that truly support your students. That’s why I created this website—to share a collection of free, easy-to-access resources that can help you in your classroom. Here, you’ll find a variety of tools, websites, and ideas designed to support your multilingual learners, save you planning time, and make teaching a little easier. I also include suggestions and tips to help you use these resources effectively and create an engaging, inclusive classroom. My hope is that these resources will inspire you, empower your students, and make your bilingual teaching journey a little smoother.</p>
    <p>This website is also meant to be a friendly space where bilingual teachers can feel supported and connected. Teaching in a multilingual classroom can be challenging, but it’s also incredibly rewarding—and you’re not alone! Here, you’ll find tried-and-true ideas, practical tips, and inspiration to spark creativity in your lessons. Think of this site as a little helper in your teaching journey—a place to discover new tools, share strategies, and find encouragement whenever you need it. I hope it becomes a resource you return to again and again, and that it makes your classroom a joyful, engaging place for both you and your students.</p>
